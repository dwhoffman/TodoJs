<p>
	This project is simply a mechanism for my personal learning of various javascript frameworks and tools.
	<br/>
	My primary focus at this point is learning Node.js. However, I plan to learn some other javascript awesomeness via libraries and frameworks such as Knockout and Backbone.
	<br/>
	The plan currently is to start building a simple REST service in Node, and then develop some clients using the other frameworks, adding them in as they become useful.
